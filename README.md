## DUE: by 9:30AM EST, Wednesday, July 28

## Introduction

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository
contains the starter files for a class activity.

In this class we will use GitHub for all course materials and most of the assignments. We will also
use Markdown for writing. This activity invites students to use the Markdown language as they respond to exercise questions.

## Tasks

After completing your activity, please `commit` and `push` your work to GitHub by typing the below commands one by one in your terminal window. Please make sure you are in your working repository (not the course `classDocs/` repository) when you type these commands.

	- `git add .` OR 	`git add -A`

	- `git commit -m "Replace this text with your own commit message"`

	- `git push`

After using the above commands, please refresh your web browser with this activity repository on GitHub and make sure that you see your changes have been committed correctly.
